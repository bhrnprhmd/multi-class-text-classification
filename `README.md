Multi-class text classification (general framework)

This is a general framework for performing multi-class text classification. Depending on the dataset that you are using, you may need to perform lemmatization, SMOTE, etc. to preprocess your data.
This model implements a TFIDF vectorizer to extract textual data. Features are then fed into a SVM classifier.
